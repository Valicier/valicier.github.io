	<p>Transcript of communication with Mining Transport 2, “Somniorum”</p>
	<p>2178/04/15 13:58:23 UTC</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>13:58:23</p>
	<p>Hernandez, O: Control, this is Captain Olivia Hernandez of Mining Transport 2, the Somniorum. We are currently about 1.47 AU from Earth orbit. One of the men was on watch when he noticed an anomaly on the sensors about 20,000 kilometers from the ship. We have not yet approached and are staying on course. Science Officer Gilberts has been running scans on the object, though the sensor equipment on our ship is not designed for this sort of range. Do we have permission to approach.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>14:15:35</p>
	<p>Controller: Somniorum, this is Control. You say an anomaly. Do you have any more information on that. We are currently gathering a team, and they would like you to send any data you have obtained so far. Slow to 15,000 kmph and prepare for course adjustment when approved.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>14:58:25</p>
	<p>Hernandez, O: We have not been able to obtain a clear visual on it. From this distance, the anomaly seems to be 200-300 meters across and black, noticeable mainly by its blocking of the stars. We are also noticing small fluctuations on the lower end of the EM spectrum. I am sending the data now. We have slowed to 15,000 kmph and are prepared to change course.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>15:06:12</p>
	<p>Controller: The team here is listening to everything you send through. You are approved for course adjustment. Approach no closer than 10 kilometers from the anomaly but stop earlier if you feel something is wrong. Be warned that the EM fluctuations may cause some radio interference as you approach, though we expect minimal problems, and it poses no danger.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>16:00:44</p>
	<p>Hernandez, O: We are currently 10 kilometers from the anomaly. It is not natural.</p>
	<p>It appears to be a hexagonal ring with an outer edge that looks metallic. Maybe copper or bronze colored.  The interior is as black as the space around us, and would seem to be a hole, except that the stars are gone. The black also seems to swirl and ripple, almost like water that has been disturbed.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>16:09:11</p>
	<p>Controller: Do not approach closer. Keep your current distance and continue to observe the structure. We do not know what it is or what it can do. Send a report by 17:15:00.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>17:25:27</p>
	<p>Hernandez, O: This is Hernandez reporting for the 17:05:00 checkup. We can’t make heads or tails of this thing. Even looking at it for prolonged periods of time is difficult. We are sending some pictures back with this transmission that will hopefully help explain why.</p>
	<p>At first look, it seems that the pictures were all taken from the same angel. This is not the case. We have been going around the structure and it seems to rotate with us. There is no sign of any thrusters or other form of propulsion to account for the rotation.</p>
	<p>We are seeking permission to send out an unmanned mining probe. It won’t give us any fancy information, but we should be able to get a video feed, as well as some mineral data and surface telemetry if we’re lucky.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>17:42:09</p>
	<p>Controller: The scientists are busy puzzling over the information you have provided. You have permission to launch a probe. Just remember to watch your fuel, you still have to get home. Send a report by 18:45:00.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>18:53:08</p>
	<p>Henandez, O: The probe has reached 2 kilometers from the anomaly. You’ve got to see this. I am sending two images taken at the same time, one from the ship and one from the probe. </p>
	<p>Since launching the probe, the ship and the probe have drifted apart, yet in these images, the anomaly looks identical. There is no rotation of the anomaly at all. One would think that it would have to face one or another, yet it faces both. It is making some of the crew nauseas trying to understand this thing.</p>
	<p>The rest of the probe data doesn’t show much, but we are sending that as well.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>19:09:56</p>
	<p>Controller: The facility here is going crazy. There has been a meeting going on with the scientists and big wigs since that 17:15:00 check-in, and this information is being carefully scrutinized. I have no orders for you right now but will hopefully have some by 19:50:00. Continue what you are doing and wait for orders.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>19:42:14</p>
	<p>Controller: Captain Hernandez, we have orders for you. You are to launch the probe through the anomaly. After it hits the anomaly, you are to wait 15 minutes and then report back.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>20:40:32</p>
	<p>Hernandez, O: You won’t believe this. As soon as the probe impacted the anomaly, it vanished. Gone. Almost exactly 1.27 seconds later we received new data from the probe. The star patterns that it sees are not the same as what we are. </p>
	<p>It’s not a THING, it’s a gateway. A gateway into the unknown.</p>
