	<h2 class="section">Finding Star Positions</h2>
	<section>
		<p>Since Humanity first looked to the stars, ways had to be found to keep track of the stars location in space. At first, they looked for patterns in the stars, later called constilations, and would use these to keep track of the stars motion. Later, astrnomers used astrolabes to folow he stas as they moved across the sky. Up until use of the GATE became reliable, most astronomers used the Equatorial Coordinate System. This used two angles, the right ascension and the declination. Right ascension measures the horizontal angle along the Earth's equator and declination measures the vertical angle from the equator.</p>
		
		<p>For the first jumps, this system worked well. If you knew a star had a GATE, all you had to do was follow the angles through the GATE (The distance between the Earth and the GATE is small enough that the angles do not change). Once there, the ship would find its postion using trilateration and four pulsars, as well as the ships relative angle to these pulsars, to know at which position and angle they came in. On the way back, all you had to do was return to your original position and reverse your angle, and you were back home (Though their were many ships that never returned home, and missaligned jumps is a common theory on why).</p>
		
		<p>Problems arose when planning how to jump between systems where neither was Earth. Assuming you can see the star of your destination, it would be possible to estimate the angle needed, though this is a very risky technique. Additonaly, since stars are rarley visible past 1,000 light years (LY) with the naked eye, this makes visual estimation even more risky. In order to solve the problem, the Galactic Coordinate System was created.</p>

	<h2 class="section">Galactic Coordinate System</h2>
	<section>

		<p>This system works like a regular grid system with the Sol sytem being the origin point. The "up" direction on the grid, refered to as Galactic North, is drawn between Sol and through the Galactic Center. This gives a starting angle from which measurments along the
			<abbr title="The plane in which most of the galaxy's stars lie">Galactic Plane</abbr>
		can be taken. The largest divisons of the Galactic Coordinate System are the quadrents. These are numbered one to four, starting from Galactic North and going counter clockwise(CCW).</p>
		
		<p>These are then broken into sectors. The full grid is 12 sectors wide in the x direction and 11 sectors wide in the y direction. Becuase space is a three dimensional thing, a z value is also needed. To do this, the grid is also technicly two sectors thick. The z value is special, because rather than its origin being on the Sol sytem, it is on the Galactic Plane. Each sector is a 10,000 LY cube for ease is measuring. The final division is the Local Coordinate System.</p>
		
		<p>In the Local Coordinate System, each sector is divided into a 1,000 unit cube with the origin on the corner closest to the Galactic Origin. This means that each unit is 10 LY, small enough to not often casue issues, and giving systems offical names helps to overcome this problem. When comunicating a systems full coordinates, they are given as <i>ABC(D,E,F)</i>, where <i>A</i> is the quadrent, <i>B</i> is the sector's x value, <i>C</i> is the system's y value, and <i>D</i>, <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are the respective x, y, and z Local Coordinates. If the value of any Local Coordinate would be less than three digits, add leading zeros.</p>
		
		<p>It should be noted that since the central bulge is 10,000 light years thick, the z value will never be larger than ±999, and since the galactic disc is 1,000 light years thick, often little more than ±100. The z direction is also the only coordinate which can have a negative direction.</p>

	<h2 class="section">Plotting Jumps (AKA: The Math)</h2>
	<section>
		<p>This is the part that most people hate, trying to plot the jumps. While the math is not complex, it is also not inatley intuitive and normally left to computers. Navigators and most captains know how to do the math the old fashion way in case they have to do it, and once you learn it once, it looks much less complex.</p>
		
		<p>In order to plot a jump between systems, two values need to be known. These are the angle to the destination along the Galactic Plane, also known as Right Ascension (&theta;), and the angle of the destination above or below the Galactic Plane, also known as Declination (&phi;). This may sound similar to the Equatorial Coordinate System, and that is beacause it is. These both are based on knowing at what angles from you an object lies. However, rather than only working near the Sol sytem, jump angles can be calculated to connect any two locations in the Galaxy, assuming you know the Galactic Coordinates of both locations.</p>
		<center><img src="../images/Navigation Angle Image.png" alt="Navigation Angles" height="200"></center>
		
		<p>Before getting into the math, it is important to understand how the values from the Galactic Coordinate System convert into values that can be used for math, know as Decimal Coordinates. First, the Local Coordinates must be worked into the Sector Coodinates. To do this, take each Local Coordinate and divide it by 1,000. You may remeber that this is how many sections each edge of a sector is broken into. Now add this to the Sector Coordinates to obtain the Decimal Coodinates (Since there is nothing to add the z value to, its value is its final result).</p>
		
		<p>Next, it must be determnined if the x and y Decimal Cordinates are positve or negative. To do this, look at the quadrent number and use the table below.</p>

		<p>This use of positives and negatives is done to differentiate the values to ensure that the correct angle is obtained. Since z is already given as positive or negative, it is all set. If this is confusing, do not worry, a navigation comupter will autmoaticlly do all this when given a set of coordinates.</p>
		
		<p>Calculations for Right Ascension and Declination are done using trigonometry, which is math concerned with relationships between angles and lengths. For our calcualtions, we are concerned with the relationships in right triangles. These calculations can be performed in any unit, be it light years, sectors, or something else as long as all the units used as the same. The first equation is the equation for finding the Right Ascension. This equation uses only the x and y coordinates, and is written as
			\[ \theta_0 = tan^{-1} \left\lvert {{o_2-o_1} \over {a_2-a_1}} \right\lvert \]
		where <i>o</i> is the coordinates along the opposite leg of the triangle from the desired angle, and <i>a</i> is the coordinates along the adjacent leg. Subscript 2 denotes the destination, while subscript 1 denotes the starting position. When drawing the right traignle, if the destination seems to be towards the 1st or 3rd quadrent, draw the line from your starting position verticaly. If the destination seems to be towards the 2nd or 4th quadrent, draw the line from your starting position horizontaly. Now draw another line connecting the end of this line to the destination. The angle you are looking for is the one in the corner with the starting position.</p>

		<p>Unforanutly, do to how arc tangent works, this will only give you a value between 0&deg; and 90&deg;. To account for this, a multiple of 90&deg; needs to be added. Since the angle systems starts at Galactic North and goes CCW, this is the direction in which the angles increase. The table below shows how much to add to &theta;<sub>0</sub> in order to get the final angle &theta;, depending on into which quadrent the destination seems to be.</p>

		<p>In toder to find Declination, the equation used is written as
			\[ \phi = tan^{-1} \left\lvert {{z_2-z_1} \over \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}} \right\lvert \]
		where <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> are the respective Decimal Coordinates. Subscript 2 denotes the destination, while subscript 1 denotes the starting position.</p>
		
		<p>By using the obtained Right Ascension and Declination angles, it is possible to go between any two points. Again, don't panic, there will almost always be a navigational computer available to do the math for you.</p>
		
		<h3>Angle Calculation Example</h3>
		<table class="wide">

				<td width=225px>
					<img src="../images/Navigation Math Example.png" alt=" Navigation Math Example" height="200">
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>In the example image shown to the left, assume that you are at the green X with coordiantes 121(372,520,-032) and wish to go to the red X with cordiantes 210(193,215,087). Converting this to Decimal Coordinates, your location would be given as (2.372,1.520,-0.032) and your destinations location as (1.193,-1.215,0.087). To solve for the Right Ascension, the equation would be
						\[ \theta = tan^{-1} \left\lvert {{1.193-2.372} \over {-1.215-1.520}} \right\lvert + 180^\circ = 214.20^\circ. \]
					The 180&deg; is added beacuse the destination heads towards the third quadrent. To find the Declination, the equation would be
						\[ \phi = tan^{-1} \left\lvert {{0.087-(-0.032)} \over \sqrt{(1.193-2.372)^2+(-1.215-1.520)^2}} \right\lvert = 3.25^\circ. \]

	<h2 class="section">Finding Yourself</h2>
	<section>
		<p>In this great big Galaxy of ours, it can be diffiuclt to know where you are. In order to find your location, trilateration is performed using known millisecond x-ray pulsars. Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit large amount of electromagnetic (EM) radiation from it magnetic poles. These bursts are refered to as pulses. The reason that pulsars make such good navigational points is becasue the interval between the pulses (caused by the rotation) is extremely consistent, rivaling that of atomic clocks. The rotational period, and thus the pulse, is also differnet for every pulsar, meaning that the pulses works like a fingerprint for pulsars.</p>
		<center><img src="../images/Pulsar Diagram 1.png" alt="Pulsar Diagram" height="350"></center>
		
		<p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are a type of pulsar that have rotational periods less than about 10 milliseconds. The advatnage of this type is that you can quickly take multiple measurments in order to verify its unique period. X-ray Pulsars are another subset of pulsars. These emmit, as the name impplies, X-rays. The advantage of X-rays over other parts of the other parts of the EM spectrum, say visible light, is that X-ray telescopes can be made much smaller than their counterparts. Luckily, some pulsars combine both of these properties. These are refered to as millisecond X-ray pulsars (MSXPs).</p>
		<center><img src="../images/EM Spectrum.png" alt="EM Spectrum" width="100%"></center>
		
		<p>In order to trilaterate your position, you need at least four pulsars that have a known pulse and position. An interesting feature of the EM spectrum is that lower frequency waves travel slower through the intersteller medium than high frequency signals. By using this diference in time, it is possible to determine the distance to the pulsar. Once the distance to one pulsar is known, you know that you are on the outer surface of a sphere centered on that pulsar. Doing this with a second pulsar narrows your location to the edge of an oval on the intersection of the two spheres. With a third pulsar, you are left with two options where all three intersect. Finally, using the distance from a forth pulsar gives you a singal intersection point,and thus your final location. While four is the minimum needed, a greater numebr allows for more accurate positioning.</p>
		<center><img src="../images/Trilateration Diagram.png" alt="Trilateration Diagram" height="350"></center>
		
		<p>New pulsars are identified in a similar manner, just revered. If you travel to four (or more) known locations from where the pulsars pusle and distance can be measured, than you can use trilateration to find the puslar, just using your location as the origin of each circle.</p>
