The 2152 GATE Probes were designed to be sent through the GATE, obtain what data they could, and return if possible. They were equiped with radio lasers for sending data and recieving commmands, but were able to scan autonomously. Three stripped down probes were also made, consisting only of camera, radio laser, and thrusters, which were used to test basic concepts of the GATE before sending real probes.
